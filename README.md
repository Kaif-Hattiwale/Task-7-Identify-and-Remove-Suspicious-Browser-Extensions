Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

📄 Overview
This task focuses on identifying and removing potentially harmful or unused browser extensions to enhance browser security and performance.  
It was completed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship.

🎯 Objective
To identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions in order to:
- Improve browser performance
- Reduce security risks from malicious extensions

🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (latest version)

📝 Steps Taken
1. Opened Google Chrome and navigated to:
   - Menu → More Tools → Extensions
   - Or directly visited: chrome://extensions/
2. Reviewed all installed extensions carefully.
3. Checked each extension’s permissions and purpose.
4. Verified publisher authenticity and checked online reviews.
5. Looked for:
   - Extensions I don’t remember installing
   - Extensions requesting excessive permissions (e.g., access to all websites, reading clipboard data)
   - Poorly rated or no longer maintained extensions
6. Identified suspicious/unused extensions.
7. Removed them by clicking Remove.
8. Restarted the browser to apply changes.

🚫 Extensions Removed
Extension Name         | Reason for Removal
---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
Css peeper  | Unknown developer, last updated 2019, excessive permissions
Quick PDF Merge        | Not in use, permissions to read/write all data on visited sites

✅ Outcome
- Removed two suspicious/unused extensions.
- Browser performance improved (faster startup).
- Reduced risk from potentially malicious extensions.

📌 Awareness Notes
Malicious browser extensions can:
- Steal login credentials
- Track browsing history and personal data
- Insert ads or malicious scripts into webpages
- Redirect users to phishing websites

🔒 Preventive Measures
- Install extensions only from trusted sources.
- Review permissions before installation.
- Keep extensions updated or remove unused ones.
- Periodically audit installed extensions for security.
